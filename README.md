# Lab 5
**Interfaces. Abstract classes.**

### Task 1:
Create a superclass Geometric figure and subclasses Quadrilateral, Triangle, Square, Oval, Parallelogram, Rhombus. Think about which of the above subclasses can also be superclasses. Use the constructor to set the color of each figure. Determine the circumference of the circle in those shapes in which it is possible. Print the size of each angle in degrees in those figures where it is possible. Implement a function that determines whether a point on the coordinate axis belongs to the specified figure.
